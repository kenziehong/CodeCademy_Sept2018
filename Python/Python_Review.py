PYTHON SYNTAX
Review
Great! So far we’ve looked at:

Print statements
How to create, modify, and use variables
Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication
How to use comments to make your code easy to understand
Different data types, including strings, ints, floats, and booleans
Converting between data types

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Variables
In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time. That data could be the location of a plane, or the time of day, or the television show you're currently watching. The only important thing is that it may be different at different times. Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.

Updating Variables
Changing the contents of a variable is one of the essential operations. As the flow of a program progresses, data should be updated to reflect changes that have happened.

STRINGS & CONSOLE OUTPUT
And Now, For Something Completely Familiar
Great job! You've learned a lot in this unit, including:

Three ways to create strings

'Alpha'
"Bravo"
str(3)
String methods

len("Charlie")
"Delta".upper()
"Echo".lower()
Printing a string

print "Foxtrot"
Advanced printing techniques

g = "Golf"
h = "Hotel"
print "%s, %s" % (g, h)

-------------------------------------------------
DATE AND TIME

from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()

print '%02d-%02d-%04d' % (now.month, now.day, now.year)

print '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (now.hour, now.minute, now.second)

print '%02d/%02d/%04d %02d:%02d:%02d' % (now.month, now.day, now.year, now.hour, now.minute, now.second)

-------------------------------------------

CONDITIONALS & CONTROL FLOW
The Big If
Really great work! Here's what you've learned in this unit:

Comparators

3 < 4
5 >= 5
10 == 10
12 != 13
Boolean operators

True or False 
(3 < 4) and (5 >= 5)
this() and not that()
Conditional statements

if this_might_be_true():
  print "This really is true."
elif that_might_be_true():
  print "That is true."
else:
  print "None of the above."
Let's get to the grand finale.LEARN PYTHON_Python Mad Libs_Project.py
