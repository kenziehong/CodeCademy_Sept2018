QUERIES
Review
Congratulations!

We just learned how to query data from a database using SQL. We also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.

Let's summarize:

SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
AS renames a column or table.
DISTINCT return unique values.
WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
ORDER BY sorts the result.
LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
CASE creates different outputs.

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
Review
Congratulations!

You just learned how to use aggregate functions to perform calculations on your data. What can we generalize so far?

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column
Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.

GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
HAVING limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property
