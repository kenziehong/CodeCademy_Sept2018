QUERIES
Select

SELECT is used every time you want to query data from a database and * means all columns.
#Line breaks don't mean anything specific in SQL. We could write this entire query in one line, and it would run just fine.

#select the name and genre columns of the table.
SELECT name, genre, year
FROM movies;

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
As

AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias.

#select the imdb_rating column and rename it as IMDb.
SELECT imdb_rating AS 'IMDb' FROM movies;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Distinct

DISTINCT is used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s).

#return the unique values of the year column instead.
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM movies;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Where

We can restrict our query results using the WHERE clause in order to obtain only the information we want.
WHERE clause filters the result set to only include rows where the following condition is true.

#retrieve all the recent movies, specifically those that were released after 2014.
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year > 2014;

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Like I

when you want to compare similar values.
LIKE is a special operator used with the WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column.

The _ means you can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern. 

#select all movies that start with 'Se' and end with 'en' and have exactly one character in the middle
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Like II

% is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern. 
We can also use % both before and after a pattern:

#selects all the information about the movie titles that begin with the word 'The'.
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE 'The %';

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Is Null

Unknown values are indicated by NULL
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as = and !=.

#Write a query to find all the movies without an IMDb rating.
#Select only the name column!
SELECT name FROM movies WHERE imdb_rating IS NULL;


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Between

filter the result set within a certain range

#select all information about movies whose name begins with the letter 'D','E','F' 
#(BETWEEN two letters is not inclusive of the 2nd letter.)
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name BETWEEN 'D' AND 'G';

#selects all information about movies that were released in the 1970's 
#(BETWEEN two numbers is inclusive of the 2nd number.)
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979;


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
And
Or

Sometimes we want to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause to make the result set more specific and useful.
AND operator displays a row if all the conditions are true.
OR operator displays a row if any condition is true.

#Now, let's retrieve every movie released in the 70's, that's also well received.
SELECT * FROM movies 
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979 
  AND imdb_rating > 8;


#write a new query that selects all movies made prior to 1985 that are also in the horror genre.
SELECT * FROM movies 
WHERE year < 1985 
  AND genre = 'horror';

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014
   OR genre ='action';
  
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE genre = 'romance' 
   OR genre ='comedy';
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Order By

ORDER BY is a clause that indicates you want to sort the result set by a particular column.
Note: ORDER BY always goes after WHERE (if WHERE is present).

#retrieve the name, year columns of all the movies, ordered by their name alphabetically
SELECT name, year FROM movies ORDER BY name;

#retrieves the name, year, and imdb_rating columns of all the movies, ordered highest to lowest by their ratings.
SELECT name, year, imdb_rating FROM movies ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC;    


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
QUERIES
Limit

LIMIT is a clause that lets you specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have. This saves space on our screen and makes our queries run faster.

#write a query that returns the top 3 highest rated movies.Select all the columns.
SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC LIMIT 3;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QUERIES
Case

A CASE statement allows us to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement).
Each WHEN tests a condition and the following THEN gives us the string if the condition is true.
The ELSE gives us the string if all the above conditions are false.
The CASE statement must end with END


#Select the name column and use a CASE statement to create the second column that is. Rename the whole CASE statement to 'Mood' using AS
SELECT name,
 CASE
  WHEN genre = 'romance' THEN 'Chill'
  WHEN genre = 'comedy' THEN 'Chill'
  ELSE 'Intense'
 END 
 AS 'Mood'
FROM movies; 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;

++++++++++++++++++

SUM() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

+++++++++++++++++++++

The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

SELECT MAX(price)
FROM fake_apps;

++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL uses the AVG() function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM fake_apps;

+++++++++++++++++

We can make the result table easier to read using the ROUND() function.
SQL rounds the values in "the column name" to "integer" decimal places in the output.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price),2)
FROM fake_apps;

++++++++++++++++++

GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.

The GROUP BY statement comes after any WHERE statements, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT.

SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;


SELECT category, 
   price,
   AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY 1, 2;

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can't use WHERE here because we don't want to filter the rows; we want to filter groups.

HAVING is very similar to WHERE. In fact, all types of WHERE clauses you learned about thus far can be used with HAVING.

When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE.
When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING.
HAVING statement always comes after GROUP BY, but before ORDER BY and LIMIT.

SELECT price, 
   ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
   COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price
HAVING COUNT(*)>10;

Merge on Specific Columns

#merge two DataFrames whose columns don't match.
#One way that we could address this problem is to use .rename to rename the columns for our merges. In the example below, we will rename the column id to customer_id, so that orders and customers have a common column for the merge.

MULTIPLE TABLES
Combining Tables with SQL

#we use the syntax table_name.column_name to be sure that our requests for columns are unambiguous. 
#In our example, we use this syntax in the ON statement, but we will also use it in the SELECT or any other statement where we refer to column names.

-- First query
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
	ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

-- Second query
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
	ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';

MULTIPLE TABLES
Primary Key vs Foreign Key

/*
Each of these tables has a column that uniquely identifies each row of that table:

These special columns are called primary keys.

Primary keys have a few requirements:

None of the values can be NULL.
Each value must be unique (i.e., you can't have two customers with the same customer_id in the customers table).
A table can not have more than one primary key column.

When the primary key for one table appears in a different table, it is called a foreign key.

So customer_id is a primary key when it appears in customers, but a foreign key when it appears in orders

*/

++++++++++++++++++++++++

MULTIPLE TABLES
Cross Join

A more common usage of CROSS JOIN is when we need to compare each row of a table to a list of values.


SELECT month, 
  COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE start_month <= month 
  AND end_month >= month
GROUP BY month;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MULTIPLE TABLES
Union

Sometimes we just want to stack one dataset on top of the other. Well, the UNION operator allows us to do that.

SQL has strict rules for appending data:

Tables must have the same number of columns.
The columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.

SELECT *
FROM newspaper 
UNION
SELECT *
FROM online ;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

MULTIPLE TABLES
With

#Often times, we want to combine two tables, but one of the tables is the result of another calculation.
#Essentially, we are putting a whole first query inside the parentheses () and giving it a name. After that, we can use this name as if it's a table and write a new query using the first query.

WITH previous_query AS (
   SELECT customer_id,
      COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT customers.customer_name, 
   previous_query.subscriptions
FROM previous_query
JOIN customers
  ON previous_query.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
