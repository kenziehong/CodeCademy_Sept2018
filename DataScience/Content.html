Why Data Science?
Every company is searching for data-driven decision makers, and this path will teach you the skills you need to become just that. You'll learn to manipulate data with SQL and Python, the foundational languages of data science and analytics. Along the way, you'll complete real-world projects like analyzing a sales funnel and building a Machine Learning powered recommendation engine.

What Youâ€™ll Learn:

The Importance of Data and SQL Basics
-----------------------------------------
Learn about the tools Data Analysts use to find insights in datasets and the basic syntax of the SQL language.


SQL: Basics
----------------------------------------
Learn the basics of SQL databases and write your first queries.


SQL: Intermediate
-------------------------------------
Increase the number of tools in your SQL toolset by learning about aggregates and multiple tables.


Python Functions and Logic
-------------------------------------------
Learn the basics of abstraction, as you create repeatable blocks of code and tell your program how to navigate through the instructions you provide for it.


Python Lists and Loops
-----------------------------------------
Learn about Python lists for organizing your data and loops for repeating blocks of code.


Python Cumulative Project
----------------------------------------
Learn about how to fit a line to some points while combining all of your knowledge of Python so far.

Introduction to Statistics with NumPy
--------------------------------------------
Learn about NumPy, a Python library used to store arrays of numbers, organize large amounts of data, and perform statistical calculations.


Hypothesis Testing with SciPy
----------------------------------------
Learn SciPy, a Python module for comparative statistics, in order to perform many different statistical tests in code.


Data Analysis with Pandas
-------------------------------------------
Learn the basics of Pandas, an industry standard Python library that provides tools for data manipulation and analysis.


Data Visualization
---------------------------------------------
Insights mean nothing if you canâ€™t present them and convince others that the findings are important. But how do we present data in Python?


Visualization Cumulative Projects
-------------------------------------
Practice your data visualization skills on these real-world datasets.


Machine Learning: Supervised Learning ðŸ¤–
--------------------------------------------
Discover how to use supervised learning techniques, in which algorithms learn from many examples of past outcomes.


Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning ðŸ¤–
-----------------------------------------------
Learn about how to perform learning on a dataset when we donâ€™t have any of the answers to begin with. How do we look for inherent structure?
