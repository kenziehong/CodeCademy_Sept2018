LEARN PYTHON: STRINGS
Thread Shed
You've recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.

Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely out-dating register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.

All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.

#------------------------------------------------
# Start coding below!

#1+2
daily_sales_replaced = daily_sales.replace(";,;","+")
#print(daily_sales_replaced)

#3.Now we can split the string into a list of each individual transaction. Split daily_sales_replaced around commas and save it to a new list daily_transactions.
daily_transactions = daily_sales_replaced.split(",")
#print(daily_transactions)

#5.Our next step is to split each individual transaction into a list of its data points. First, define an empty list daily_transactions_split
daily_transactions_split=[]
for element in daily_transactions:
  daily_transactions_split.append(element.split("+"))
#print(daily_transactions_split)  

#8.It looks like each data item has inconsistent whitespace around it. First, define an empty list transactions_clean. Now, Iterate through daily_transactions_split and for each transaction iterate through the different data points and strip off any whitespace. Add each of these cleaned up transactions to the new list transactions_clean
transactions_clean = []
for element in daily_transactions_split:
  element_clean=[]
  for item in element:
    element_clean.append(item.replace("\n","").strip())
  transactions_clean.append(element_clean)  
#print(transactions_clean)  

#10.Create three empty lists. customers, sales, and thread_sold. We are going to collect the individual data points for each transaction in these lists.
customers=[]
sales=[]
thread_sold=[]

#11.Now, iterate through transactions_clean and for each transaction: Append the customers name to customers. Append the amount of the sale to sales. Append the threads sold to thread_sold
for element in transactions_clean:
  customers.append(element[0])
  sales.append(element[1])
  thread_sold.append(element[2])
#print(customers)
#print(sales)
#print(thread_sold)

#Determine the total value of the days sales

#13. Now we want to know how much Thread Shed made in a day. First, define a variable called total_sales and set it equal to 0
total_sales = 0

#14. Now, consider the list sales. It is a list of strings that we want to sum. In order for us to sum these values, we will have to remove the $, and set them equal to floats. Iterate through sales and for each item, strip off the $, set it equal to a float, and add it to total_sales
for element in sales:
  total_sales += float(element.strip("$"))
#print(total_sales)

#How much thread of any specific color was sold?

#16.Finally, we want to determine how many of each color thread we sold today. Let's start with a single color, and then we'll generalize it. First, print out thread_sold and inspect it.
#17. We see that thread_sold is a list of strings, some are single colors and some are multiple colors separated by the & character.The end product we want here is a list that contains an item for each color thread sold, so no strings that have multiple colors in them. First, define an empty list thread_sold_split.
thread_sold_split=[]
for element in thread_sold:
  thread_sold_split.append(element.split("&"))
print(thread_sold_split)  

#19. Great, now we have a list thread_sold_split that contains an entry with the color of every thread sold today. Define a function called color_count that takes one argument, color. The function should iterate through thread_sold_split and count the number of times the item is equal to argument, color. Then, it should return this count.
def color_count(color):
  color_count=0
  for element in thread_sold_split:
    if color in element:
      color_count +=1
  return color_count    
print(color_count("white"))    

#21.Define a list called colors that stores all of the colored threads that Thread Shed offers:
colors=["red", "yellow", "green", "white", "black", "blue", "purple"]

#22.Now, using the list colors, the string method .format(), and the function color_count, iterate through thread_sold_split and print a sentence that says how many threads of each color were sold today.
for element in colors:
  print("Thread Shed sold {} threads of {} thread today".format(color_count(element), element))
