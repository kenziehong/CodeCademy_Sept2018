NAVIGATION
Generalizations
Congratulations! You've learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.
ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.
cd switches you into the directory you specify.
mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.
touch creates a new file inside the working directory.

BASIC GIT WORKFLOW
Generalizations
You have now been introduced to the fundamental Git workflow. You learned a lot! Let's take a moment to generalize:

Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers
Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
git init creates a new Git repository
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log shows a list of all previous commits

--------------------------------------------------

CONTROL FLOW
Review
Great job! We covered a ton of material in this lesson and you've increased the number of tools in your Python toolkit by several fold. Let's review what you've learned this lesson:

Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False
A boolean variable is a variable that is set to either True or False.
You can create boolean expressions using relational operators:
Equals: ==
Not equals: !=
Greater than: >
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than: <
Less than or equal to: <=
if statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
else statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.
elif statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements
try and except statements can be used to build error control into your code.
Let's put these skills to the test!

CREATING AND MODIFYING A LIST IN PYTHON
Review
So far, we have learned

How to create a list
How to create a list of lists using zip
How to add elements to a list using either .append() or +
How to use range to create lists of integers
Let's practice these skills.

---------------------------------------------------

WORKING WITH LISTS IN PYTHON
Review
In this lesson, we learned how to:

Get the length of a list //len(list)
Select subsets of a list (called slicing) //list[ : ]
Count the number of times that an element appears in a list //list.count('i')
Sort a list of items //list.sort() # sorted(list)

----------------------------------------------
LEARN PYTHON: LOOPS
Review
Good job! In this lesson, you learned

how to write a for loop
how to use range in a loop //list(range(2,9,3))
what infinite loops are and how to avoid them //break
how to skip values in a loop //continue
how to write a while loop 
how to make lists with one line
Let's get some more practice with these concepts!


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
List Comprehensions:
1.Takes an element in words
2.Assigns that element to a variable called word
3.Checks if word[0] == '@', and if so, it adds word to the new list, usernames. If not, nothing happens.
4.Repeats steps 1-3 for all of the strings in words
Note: if we hadnâ€™t done any checking (let's say we had omitted if word[0] == '@'), the new list would be just a copy of words

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
More List Comprehensions:
1.Takes a string in usernames
2.Assigns that number to a variable called user
3.Adds " please follow me!" to user
4.Appends that concatenation to the new list called messages
5.Repeats steps 1-4 for all of the strings in usernames

INTRODUCTION TO STRINGS
Review
Great work! I hope you are now starting to see the potential of strings and how they can be used to solve a huge variety of problems.

In this lesson you learned:

A string is a list of characters.
A character can be selected from a string using its index string_name[index]. These indices start at 0.
A 'slice' can be selected from a string. These can be between two indices or can be open-ended, selecting all of the string from a point.
Strings can be concatenated to make larger strings.
len() can be used to determine the number of characters in a string.
Strings can be iterated through using for loops.
Iterating through strings opens up a huge potential for applications, especially when combined with conditional statements.
Let's put your new skills to the test!

--------------------------------------------------------------

MODULES: PYTHON
Modules Python Review
You've learned:

what modules are and how they can be useful
how to use a few of the most commonly used Python libraries
what namespaces are and how to avoid polluting your local namespace
how scope works for files in Python
Programmers can do great things if they are not forced to constantly reinvent tools that have already been built. With the power of modules, we can import any code that someone else has shared publicly.

In this article, we covered some of the Python Standard Library, but you can explore all the modules that come packaged with every installation of Python at the Python Standard Library documentation.

This is just the beginning. Using a package manager (like conda or pip3), you can install any modules available on the Python Package Index.

The sky's the limit!

STRING METHODS
Review
Excellent work! This lesson has shown you the vast variety of string methods and their power. Whatever the problem you are trying to solve, if you are working with strings then string methods are likely going to be part of the solution.

Over this lesson you've learned:

.upper(), .title(), and .lower() adjust the casing of your string.
.split() takes a string and creates a list of substrings.
.join() takes a list of strings and creates a string.
.strip() cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.
.replace() replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.
.find() searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.
.format() and f-strings allow you to interpolate a string with variables.
Well I've been stringing you along for long enough, let's get some more practice in!
