## Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

[Strategies]
  - Defines a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable

[Command]
  - Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
  - This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.
  
[Template]
  - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
