INTRODUCTION TO HTML
What is HTML?

<!-- Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It's often the first language learned by marketers and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we're excited for what you're about to create.

So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.
Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, we're going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. Don't worry if the websites look ugly — we're just getting started.

INTRODUCTION TO HTML
HTML Anatomy

<!-- HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. Let's take a look at how they're written.

The diagram to the right displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of one opening tag (<p>), the content (“Hello World!” text), and a closing tag (</p>). A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

Let's quickly review each part of the element pictured:

HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.

Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

Study the diagram to the right to learn about the anatomy of HTML syntax. When you're done, continue to the next exercise.
 -->
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
The Body

<!-- One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the body element. Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen. Here's what opening and closing body tags look like:

<body>

</body>
Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.

<body>
   <p>"Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." - Audre Lorde</p>
</body> -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
HTML Structure

<!-- HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <p> tags within <body> tags. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.

<body>
  <p>This paragraph is a child of the body</p>
</body>
In the example above, the <p> element is nested inside the <body> element. The <p> element is considered a child of the <body> element, and the <body> element is considered the parent. You can also see that we've added two spaces of indentation (using the space bar) for better readability.

Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.

Let's consider a more complicated example that uses some new tags:

<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Sibling to p, but also grandchild of body</h1>
    <p>Sibling to h1, but also grandchild of body</p>
  </div>
</body>
In this example, the <body> element is the parent of the <div> element. Both the <h1> and <p> elements are children of the <div> element. Because the <h1> and <p> elements are at the same level, they are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the <body> element.

Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element. You'll learn more about webpage hierarchy in when you start digging into CSS.

INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Headings

<!-- Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other types of media. For example, in newspapers, large headings are typically used to capture a reader's attention. Other times, headings are used to describe content, like the title of a movie or an educational article.

HTML follows a similar pattern. In HTML, there are six different headings, or heading elements. Headings can be used for a variety of purposes, like titling sections, articles, or other forms of content.

The following is the list of heading elements available in HTML. They are ordered from largest to smallest in size.

<h1> — used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings.
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>
The following example code uses a headline intended to capture a reader's attention. It uses the largest heading available, the main heading element:

<h1>BREAKING NEWS</h1>
 -->

 <body>
  <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
  <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
  <h3>Species</h3>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
  <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
  <h2>Media</h2>  
</body>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Divs

<!-- One of the most popular elements in HTML is the <div> element. <div> is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.

<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
    <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
  </div>
</body>
<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of <div>s for better readability.
 -->
<body>
  <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
    <h3>Species</h3>
    <h3>Features</h3>
  </div> 
  <div>
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <h3>Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations</h3>
    <h3>Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations</h3>
  </div> 
  <div>
    <h2>Media</h2>
  </div>
</body>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Attributes

<!-- If we want to expand an element's tag, we can do so using an attribute. Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling. Attributes are made up of the following two parts:

The name of the attribute
The value of the attribute
One commonly used attribute is the id. We can use the id attribute to specify different content (such as <div>s) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once. ids have several different purposes in HTML, but for now, we'll focus on how they can help us identify content on our page.

When we add an id to a <div>, we place it in the opening tag:

<div id="intro">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
 -->

1.
Add an id attribute with the value "introduction" to the <div> tag that's below the The Brown Bear <h1> heading.

2.
Add an id attribute with the value "habitat" to the opening <div> tag that has the Habitat <h2> heading as a child.

3.
Add an id attribute with the value "media" to the opening <div> tag that has the Media <h2> heading as a child.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Displaying Text

<!-- If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:

Paragraphs (<p>) contain a block of plain text.
<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.
Take a look at each of these elements in action below:

<div>
  <h1>Technology</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <p><span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.</p>
</div>
In the example above, there are two different <div>. The second <div> contains a <p> with <span>Self-driving cars</span>. This <span> element separates "Self-driving cars" from the rest of the text in the paragraph.

It's best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks, it's better to use a <div>. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Styling Text

<!-- You can also style text using HTML tags. The <em> tag emphasizes text, while the <strong> tag highlights important text.

Later, when you begin to style websites, you will decide how you want browsers to display content within <em> and <strong> tags. Browsers, however, have built-in style sheets that will generally style these tags in the following ways:

The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.
Take a look at each style in action:

<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>
In this example, the <strong> and <em> tags are used to emphasize the text to produce the following:

The Nile River is the longest river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).

As we can see, "The Nile River" is bolded and "longest" is in italics. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Line Breaks

<!-- The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn't affect the positioning of elements in the browser. If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML's line break element: <br>.

The line break element is unique because it is only composed of a starting tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.

<p>The Nile River is the longest river <br> in the world, measuring over 6,850 <br> kilometers long (approximately 4,260 <br> miles).</p>
The code in the example above will result in an output that looks like the following:

The Nile River is the longest river
in the world, measuring over 6,850
kilometers long (approximately 4,260
miles). -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++==
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Unordered Lists

<!-- In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list.

In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul>) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

The <ul> element should not hold raw text and won't automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag. The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.

<ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>
In the example above, the list was created using the <ul> tag and all individual list items were added using <li> tags.

The output will look like this:

*Limes
*Tortillas
*Chicken -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Ordered Lists

<!-- Ordered lists (<ol>) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

You can create the ordered list with the <ol> tag and then add individual list items to the list using <li> tags.

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
  <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
</ol>
The output will look like this:

1.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2.Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.
3.Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.
4.Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Images

<!-- All of the elements you've learned about so far (headings, paragraphs, lists, and spans) share one thing in common: they're composed entirely of text! What if you want to add content to your web page that isn't composed of text, like images?

The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both opening and closing tags, but the <img> tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash — both will render properly.

<img src="image-location.jpg" />
The <img> tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set to the image's source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Image Alts

<!-- Part of being an exceptional web developer is making your site accessible to users of all backgrounds. In order to make the Web more inclusive, we need to consider what happens when assistive technologies such as screen readers come across image tags.

The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites. The alt attribute can be added to the image tag just like the src attribute. The value of alt should be a description of the image.

<img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />
The alt attribute also serves the following purposes:

If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is made possible by the description you provide in the alt attribute.
Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. When you include the alt attribute, the screen reading software can read the image's description out loud to the visually impaired user.
The alt attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot "see" the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.
If the image on the web page is not one that conveys any meaningful information to a user (visually impaired or otherwise), the alt attribute should be left empty. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
INTRODUCTION TO HTML
Videos

<!-- In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> tag, the <video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the <img> tag however, the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.

<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>
In this example, the video source (src) is myVideo.mp4 The source can be a video file that is hosted alongside your webpage, or a URL that points to a video file hosted on another webpage.

After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip.

The text, "Video not supported", between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video. -->

<body>
  <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
  <div id="introduction">
    <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
    <p>The brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America.

HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Preparing for HTML

<!-- Now that you've learned about some of the most common HTML elements, it's time to learn how to set up an HTML file.

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.

In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include <!DOCTYPE html> at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
The <html> tag

<!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration provides the browser with two pieces of information (the type of document and the HTML version to expect), but it doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
The Head

<!-- So far you've done two things to set up the file properly:

Declared to the browser that your code is HTML with <!DOCTYPE html>
Added the HTML element (<html>) that will contain the rest of your code.
We have added these elements to the Brown Bears page you previously created. Now, let's also give the browser some information about the page itself. We can do this by adding a <head> element.

Remember the <body> tag? The <head> element is part of this HTML metaphor. It goes above our <body> element.

The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the <body> tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. You'll see an example of this in the next exercise.

The opening and closing head tags typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag:

<head>
</head> -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Page Titles

<!-- What kind of metadata about the web page can the <head> element contain?

If you navigate to the Codecademy catalog and look at the top of your browser, you'll notice the words Catalog | Codecademy, which is the title of the web page.

A browser's tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>
If we were to open a file containing the HTML code in the example above, the browser would display the words My Coding Journal in the title bar (or in the tab's title). -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Where Does the Title Appear?

<!-- Good work! Unfortunately, the browser panel used by the Codecademy environment does not have a title bar, so the "Brown Bear" title you wrote in the previous exercise will not be displayed. Outside of the Codecademy environment, however, your title would appear as depicted in the diagram to the right.

So far, we have learned about:

<!DOCTYPE html>, the declaration specifying the version of HTML for the browser
The <html> tags that enclose all of your HTML code
The <head> tag that contains the metadata of a webpage, such as its <title>
Next, you will learn about new types of elements that go inside the body. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Linking to Other Web Pages

<!-- One of the powerful aspects of HTML (and the Internet), is the ability to link to other web pages.

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element <a> and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.

<a>This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
Wait a minute! Technically, the link in the example above is incomplete. How exactly is the link above supposed to work if there is no URL that will lead users to the actual Wikipedia page?

The anchor element in the example above is incomplete without the href attribute. This attribute stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located (whether it is on your computer or another location). The paths provided to the href attribute are often URLs.

<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
In the example above, the href attribute has been set to the value of the URL https://www.wikipedia.org/. The example now shows the correct use of an anchor element.

When reading technical documentation, you may come across the term hyperlink. Not to worry, this is simply the technical term for link. These terms are often used interchangeably. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Opening Links in a New Window

<!-- Have you ever clicked on a link and observed the resulting web page open in a new browser window? If so, you can thank the <a> element's target attribute.

The target attribute specifies how a link should open.

It's possible that one or more links on your web page link to an entirely different website. In that case, you may want users to read the linked website, but hope that they return to your web page. This is exactly when the target attribute is useful!

For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>
In the example above, setting the target attribute to "_blank" instructs the browser to open the relevant Wikipedia page in a new window.

In this exercise, we've used the terminology "open in a new window." It's likely that you are using a modern browser that opens up websites in new tabs, rather than new windows. Before the advent of browsers with tabs, additional browser windows had to be opened to view more websites. The target="_blank" attribute, when used in modern browsers, will open new websites in a new tab. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Linking to Relative Page

<!-- Thus far you have learned how to link to external web pages. Many sites also link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact.

Before we learn how to link between internal pages, let's establish where our files are stored. When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored. As the size of the projects you create grows, you may use additional folders within the main project folder to organize your code.

project-folder/
|—— about.html
|—— contact.html
|—— index.html
The example above shows three different files — about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.

HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example above. If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder. Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
In this example, the <a> tag is used with a relative path to link from the current HTML file to the contact.html file in the same folder. On the web page, Contact will appear as a link.

A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) versus an absolute path (a full URL, like https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html which is stored in a different folder). The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Linking At Will

<!-- You've probably visited websites where not all links were made up of text. Maybe the links you clicked on were images or some other form of content.

So far, we've added links that were made up of only text, like the following:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank">Prickly Pear</a>
Text-only links, however, would significantly decrease your flexibility as a web developer!

Thankfully, HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it's possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the <img> element with an <a> element.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="#" alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>
In the example above, an image of a prickly pear has been turned into a link by wrapping the outside of the <img> element with an <a> element. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Linking to Same Page

<!-- At this point, we have all the content we want on our page. Since we have so much content, it doesn't all fit on the screen. How do we make it easier for a user to jump to different portions of our page?

When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page automatically scroll to a specific section.

In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:

<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>
In this example, the <p> element is assigned an id of "top" and the <h1> element is assigned "bottom." An id can be added to most elements on a webpage.

An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link. The target link is a string containing the # character and the target element's id.

<ol>
  <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
</ol>
In the example above, the links to <p id="top"> and <h1 id="bottom"> are embedded in an ordered list. These links appear in the browser as a numbered list of links. An id is especially helpful for organizing content belonging to a div!	 -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Whitespace

<!-- The rest of this lesson will focus on some tools developers use to make code easier to interpret.

As the code in an HTML file grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of how elements are related. Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements: whitespace and indentation.

Both tools take advantage of the fact that the position of elements in a browser is independent of the amount of whitespace or indentation in the index.html file.

For example, if you wanted to increase the space between two paragraphs on your web page, you would not be able to accomplish this by adding space between the paragraph elements in the index.html file. The browser ignores whitespace in HTML files when it renders a web page, so it can be used as a tool to make code easier to read and follow.

What makes the example below difficult to read?

<body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body>
You have to read the entire line to know what elements are present. Compare the example above to this:

<body>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>
This example is easier to read, because each element is on its own line. While the first example required you to read the entire line of code to identify the elements, this example makes it easy to identify the body tag and two paragraphs.

A browser renders both examples the same way:

Paragraph 1
Paragraph 2
In the next exercise you will learn how to use indentation to help visualize nested elements.	 -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Indentation

<!-- The second tool web developers use to make the structure of code easier to read is indentation. The spaces are inserted using the space and tab bars on your keyboard.

The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, is responsible for maintaining the style standards of HTML. At the time of writing, the W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation when writing HTML code. Although your code will work without exactly two spaces, this standard is followed by the majority of professional web developers. Indentation is used to easily visualize which elements are nested within other elements.

<body>
  <p>Paragraph 1</p>
  <div>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
  </div>
</body>
In the example above, Paragraph 1 and the <div> tag are nested inside of the <body> tag, so they are indented two spaces. The Paragraph 2 element is nested inside of the <div> tag, so it is indented an additional two spaces. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS
Comments

<!-- HTML files also allow you to add comments to your code.

Comments begin with and end with. Any characters in between will be ignored by your browser.

This is a comment that the browser will not display.
Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:

They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.
They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.
Favorite Films Section
<p>The following is a list of my favorite films:</p>
In this example, the comment is used to denote that the following text makes up a particular section of the page.

<p> Test Code </p>
In the example above, a valid HTML element (a paragraph element) has been "commented out." This practice is useful when there is code you want to experiment with, or return to, in the future.	 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Brown Bears</title>

TABLES
Why Tables?

<!-- There are many websites on the Internet that display information like stock prices, sports scores, invoice data, and more. This data is naturally tabular in nature, meaning that a table is often the best way of presenting the data.

In this part of the course, you'll learn how to use HTML to present tabular data to users.

Let's begin! -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Create a Table

<!-- Before displaying data, you must first create the table that will contain the data by using the <table> element.

<table>

</table>
The <table> element will contain all of the tabular data you plan on displaying. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Table Rows

<!-- In many programs that use tables, the table is already predefined for you, meaning that it contains the rows, columns, and cells that will hold data. In HTML, all of these components must be created.

The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: <tr>.

<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  </tr>
</table>
In the example above, two rows have been added to the table.	 -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Table Data

<!-- 
Rows aren't sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: <td>.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
In the example above, two data points (73 and 81) were entered in the one row that exists. By adding two data points, we created two cells of data.

If the table were displayed in the browser, it would show a table with one row and two columns. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Table Headings

<!-- Table data doesn't make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.

To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.

The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title. Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
What happened in the code above?

First, a new row was added to hold the three headings: a blank heading, a Saturday heading, and a Sunday heading. The blank heading creates the extra table cell necessary to align the table headings correctly over the data they correspond to.

In the second row, one table heading was added as a row title: Temperature.

Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:

row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
HTML code for tables may look a little strange at first, but analyzing it piece by piece helps make the code more understandable. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

TABLES
Table Borders

<!-- So far, the tables you've created have been a little difficult to read because they have no borders.

In older versions of HTML, a border could be added to a table using the border attribute and setting it equal to an integer. This integer would represent the thickness of the border.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
The code in the example above is following is deprecated, so please don't use it. It's meant to illustrate older conventions you may come across when reading other developers' code.

The browser will likely still interpret your code correct if you use the border attribute, but that doesn't mean the attribute should be used. Instead, you can achieve the same effect using CSS.

table, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
The code in the example above uses CSS instead of HTML to show table borders. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

TABLES
Spanning Columns

<!-- What if the table contains data that spans multiple columns?

For example, a personal calendar could have events that span across multiple hours, or even multiple days.

Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. The attributes accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Out of Town</td>
    <td>Back in Town</td>
  </tr>
</table>
In the example above, the data Out of Town spans the Monday and Tuesday table headings using the value 2 (two columns). The data Back in Town appear only under the Wednesday heading. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Spanning Rows

<!-- 
Data can also span multiple rows using the rowspan attribute.

The rowspan attribute is used for data that spans multiple rows (perhaps an event goes on for multiple hours on a certain day). It accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of rows it spans across.

<table>
  <tr> Row 1
    <th></th>
    <th>Saturday</th>
    <th>Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> Row 2
    <th>Morning</th>
    <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
    <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> Row 3
    <th>Afternoon</th>
  </tr>
  <tr> Row 4
    <th>Evening</th>
    <td>Dinner</td>
  </tr>
</table>
In the example above, there are four rows:

The first row contains an empty cell and the two column headings.
The second row contains the Morning row heading, along with Work, which spans two rows under the Saturday column. The "Relax" entry spans three rows under the Sunday column.
The third row only contains the Afternoon row heading.
The fourth row only contains the Dinner entry, since "Relax" spans into the cell next to it.
If you'd like to see how the browser interprets the code above, feel free to copy and paste it into the code editor to understand it a little better. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Table Body

<!-- Over time, a table can grow to contain a lot of data and become very long. When this happens, the table can be sectioned off so that it is easier to manage.

Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: <tbody>.

The <tbody> element should contain all of the table's data, excluding the table headings (more on this in a later exercise).

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Saturday</th>
      <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
In the example above, all of the table data is contained within a table body element. Note, however, that the headings were also kept in the table's body — we'll change this in the next exercise. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Table Head

<!-- In the last exercise, the table's headings were kept inside of the table's body. When a table's body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section off the table's headings using the <thead> element.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Saturday</th>
      <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
In the example above, the only new element is <thead>. The table headings are contained inside of this element. Note that the table's head still requires a row in order to contain the table headings. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Table Footer

<!-- The bottom part of a long table can also be sectioned off using the <tfoot> element.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Quarter</th>
      <th>Revenue</th>
      <th>Costs</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Q1</th>
      <td>$10M</td>
      <td>$7.5M</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Q2</th>
      <td>$12M</td>
      <td>$5M</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <th>Total</th>
      <td>$22M</td>
      <td>$12.5M</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
In the example above, the footer contains the totals of the data in the table. Footers are often used to contain sums, differences, and other data results.	 -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TABLES
Styling with CSS

<!-- Tables, by default, are very bland. They have no borders, the font color is black, and the typeface is the same type used for other HTML elements.

You can use CSS to style tables just like you have done in the past. Specifically, you can change style the various aspects mentioned above.

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
The code in the example above demonstrates just some of the various table aspects you can style using the CSS properties you learned about earlier. -->

CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Inline Styles

<!-- Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.

To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.

<p style="color: red;">I'm learning to code!</p>
The code in the example above demonstrates how to use inline styling. The paragraph element has a style attribute within its opening tag. Next, the style attribute is set equal to color: red;, which will set the color of the paragraph text to red within the browser.

You might be wondering about the syntax of the following snippet of code: color: red;. At the moment, the details of the syntax are not important; you'll learn more about CSS syntax in other exercises. For now, it's important to know that inline styles are a quick way of directly styling an HTML element.

If you'd like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the style attribute. Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (;).

<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I'm learning to code!</p>
 -->

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
<!-- The <style> Tag

Inline styles are a fast way of styling HTML, but they also have limitations. If you wanted to style, for example, multiple <h1> elements, you would have to add inline styling to each element manually. In addition, you would also have to maintain the HTML code when additional <h1> elements are added.

Fortunately, HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element. CSS can be written between opening and closing <style> tags. To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the <head> element.

<head>
  <style>
  </style>
</head>
After adding a <style> tag in the head section, you can begin writing CSS code.

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
The CSS code in the example above changes the color of all paragraph text to red and also changes the size of the text to 20 pixels. Note how the syntax of the CSS code matches (for the most part) the syntax you used for inline styling. The main difference is that you can specify which elements to apply the styling to.

Again, the details of the CSS syntax in the example above aren't important at the moment. You will learn more about the details of CSS syntax in later lessons. -->

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
The .css file

<!-- Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files (HTML files contain only HTML code, and CSS files contain only CSS code).

You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css

With a CSS file, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Linking the CSS File

<!-- Perfect! We successfully separated structure (HTML) from styling (CSS), but the web page still looks bland. Why?

When HTML and CSS code are in separate files, the files must be linked. Otherwise, the HTML file won't be able to locate the CSS code, and the styling will not be applied.

You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together. The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:

href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
When linking an HTML file and a CSS file together, the <link> element will look like the following:

<link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
Note that in the example above the path to the stylesheet is a URL:

https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css
Specifying the path to the stylesheet using a URL is one way of linking a stylesheet.

If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a relative path instead of a URL, like so:

<link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
Using a relative path is very common way of linking a stylesheet. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Tag Name

<!-- CSS can select HTML elements by using an element's tag name. A tag name is the word (or character) between HTML angle brackets.

For example, in HTML, the tag for a paragraph element is <p>. The CSS syntax for selecting <p> elements is:

p {

}
In the example above, all paragraph elements will be selected using a CSS selector. The selector in the example above is p. Note that the CSS selector matches the HTML tag for that element, but without the angle brackets.

In addition, two curly braces follow immediately after the selector (an opening and closing brace, respectively). Any CSS properties will go inside of the curly braces to style the selected elements. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Class Name

<!-- CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute.

For example, consider the following HTML:

<p class="brand">Sole Shoe Company</p>
The paragraph element in the example above has a class attribute within the <p> tag. The class attribute is set to "brand". To select this element using CSS, we could use the following CSS selector:

.brand {

}
To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.) must be prepended to the class's name. In the example above case, the class is brand, so the CSS selector for it is .brand. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Multiple Classes

<!-- We can use CSS to select an HTML element's class attribute by name.

So far, we've selected elements using only one class name per element. If every HTML element had a single class, all the style information for each element would require a new class.

Luckily, it's possible to add more than one class name to an HTML element's class attribute.

For instance, perhaps there's a heading element that needs to be green and bold. You could write two CSS rules like so:

.green {
  color: green;
}

.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}
Then, you could include both of these classes on one HTML element like this:

<h1 class="green bold"> ... </h1>
We can add multiple classes to an HTML element's class attribute by separating them with a space. This enables us to mix and match CSS classes to create many unique styles without writing a custom class for every style combination needed. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
ID Name

<!-- 
If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element. To add an ID to an element, the element needs an id attribute:

<h1 id="large-title"> ... </h1>
Then, CSS can select HTML elements by their id attribute. To select an id element, CSS prepends the id name with a hashtag (#). For instance, if we wanted to select the HTML element in the example above, it would look like this:

#large-title {

}
The id name is large-title, therefore the CSS selector for it is #large-title. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Classes and IDs

<!-- CSS can select HTML elements by their tag, class, and ID. CSS classes and IDs have different purposes, which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements.

CSS classes are meant to be reused over many elements. By writing CSS classes, you can style elements in a variety of ways by mixing classes on HTML elements.

For instance, imagine a page with two headlines. One headline needs to be bold and blue, and the other needs to be bold and green. Instead of writing separate CSS rules for each headline that repeat each other's code, it's better to write a .bold CSS rule, a .green CSS rule, and a .blue CSS rule. Then you can give one headline the bold green classes, and the other the bold blue classes.

While classes are meant to be used many times, an ID is meant to style only one element. As we'll learn in the next exercise, IDs override the styles of tags and classes. Since IDs override class and tag styles, they should be used sparingly and only on elements that need to always appear the same. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Specificity

<!-- Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed. A best practice in CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree of specificity, so that if an element needs a new style, it is easy to override.

IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags. For example, consider the following HTML and CSS:

<h1 class="headline">Breaking News</h1>
h1 {
  color: red;
}

.headline {
  color: firebrick;
}
In the example code above, the color of the heading would be set to firebrick, as the class selector is more specific than the tag selector. If an ID attribute (and selector) were added to the code above, the styles within the ID selector's body would override all other styles for the heading. The only way to override an ID is to add another ID with additional styling.

Over time, as files grow with code, many elements may have IDs, which can make CSS difficult to edit, since a new, more specific style must be created to change the style of an element.

To make styles easy to edit, it's best to style with a tag selector, if possible. If not, add a class selector. If that is not specific enough, then consider using an ID selector. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Chaining Selectors

<!-- When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.

This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:

h1.special {

}
The code above would select only the h1 elements that have a class of special. If a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Nested Elements

<!-- In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements. For instance, consider the following HTML:

<ul class='main-list'>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
The nested <li> elements are selected with the following CSS:

.main-list li {

}
In the example above, .main-list selects the .main-list element (the unordered list element). The nested <li> are selected by adding li to the selector, separated by a space, resulting in .main-list li as the final selector (note the space in the selector).

Selecting elements in this way can make our selectors even more specific by making sure they appear in the context we expect. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Chaining and Specificity

<!-- In the last exercise, instead of selecting all h5 elements, you selected only the h5 elements nested inside the .description elements. This CSS selector was more specific than writing only h5. Adding more than one tag, class, or ID to a CSS selector increases the specificity of the CSS selector.

For instance, consider the following CSS:

p {
  color: blue;
}


.main p {
  color: red;
}
Both of these CSS rules define what a p element should look like. Since .main p has a class and a p tag as its selector, only the p elements inside the .main element will appear red. This occurs despite there being another more general rule that states p elements should be blue. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Important

<!-- There is one thing that is even more specific than IDs: !important. !important can be applied to specific attributes instead of full rules. It will override any style no matter how specific it is. As a result, it should almost never be used. Once !important is used, it is very hard to override.

The syntax of !important in CSS looks like this:

p {
  color: blue !important;
}


.main p {
  color: red;
}
Since !important is used on the p selector’s color attribute, all p elements will appear blue, even though there is a more specific .main p selector that sets the color attribute to red.

The !important flag is only useful when an element appears the same way 100% of the time. Since it's almost impossible to guarantee that this will be true throughout a project and over time, it's best to avoid !important altogether. If you ever see !important used (or are ever tempted to use it yourself) we strongly recommend reorganizing your CSS. Making your CSS more flexible will typically fix the immediate problem and make your code more maintainable in the long run.
 -->

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++
 CSS SETUP AND SELECTORS
Multiple Selectors

<!-- In order to make CSS more concise, it's possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors all at once. This prevents writing repetitive code.

For instance, the following code has repetitive style attributes:

h1 {
  font-family: Georgia;
}

.menu {
  font-family: Georgia;
}
Instead of writing font-family: Georgia twice for two selectors, we can separate the selectors by a comma to apply the same style to both, like this:

h1, 
.menu {
  font-family: Georgia;
}
By separating the CSS selectors with a comma, both the h1 and the .menu elements will receive the font-family: Georgia styling. -->

CSS VISUAL RULES
Introduction To Visual Rules

<!-- In this lesson, you'll learn the basic structure and syntax of CSS so that you can start styling web page elements.
 -->
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS VISUAL RULES
CSS Structure

<!-- To style an HTML element using CSS, you need to write a CSS declaration inside the body of a CSS selector.

h1 {
  color: blue;
}
The example above selects the <h1> element. Inside of the selector's body, we typed color: blue. This line is referred to as a CSS declaration. CSS declarations consist of a property and a value.

Property — the property you'd like to style of that element (i.e., size, color, etc.).

Value — the value of the property (i.e., 18px for size, blue for color, etc.).

In the example above, the property is color and the value is blue. The property and value are separated by a colon (:). A semicolon (;) should always be used at the end of a declaration.

Finally, the entire snippet of code in the example above is known as a CSS rule or rule set. A CSS rule consists of the selector (here, h1) and all declarations inside of the selector. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Font Family

<!-- If you've ever used a formatted word processor, chances are that you probably also used a feature that allowed you change the font you were typing in. Font refers to the technical term typeface, or font family.

To change the typeface of text on your web page, you can use the font-family property.

h1 {
  font-family: Garamond;
}
In the example above, the font family for all main heading elements has been set to Garamond.

When setting typefaces on a web page, keep the following points in mind:

The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visits the web page.
The default typeface for all HTML elements is Times New Roman. You may be familiar with this typeface if you have ever used a formatted word processor. If no font-family attribute is defined, the page will appear in Times New Roman.
It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3. This helps the page load faster in some cases and is usually a good design decision.
When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it's a best practice to enclose the typeface's name in quotes, like so:
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}
You can find a reference of web safe fonts here. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Font Size

<!-- Changing the typeface isn't the only way to customize text. Often times, different sections of a web page are highlighted by modifying the font size.

To change the size of text on your web page, you can use the font-size property.

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}
In the example above, the font-size of all paragraphs was set to 18px. px means pixels and is a way to measure font size. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Font Weight

<!-- In CSS, the font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears.

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
In the example above, all paragraphs on the web page would appear bolded.

The font-weight property has a another value: normal. Why does it exist?

If we wanted all text on a web page to appear bolded, we could select all text elements and change their font weight to bold. If a certain section of text was required to appear normal, however, we could set the font weight of that particular element to normal, essentially shutting off bold for that element. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Text Align

<!-- No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser.

To align text we can use the text-align property. The text-align property will align text to the element that holds it, otherwise known as its parent.

h1 {
  text-align: right;
}
The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:

left — aligns text to the left hand side of its parent element, which in this case is the browser.
center — centers text inside of its parent element.
right — aligns text to the right hand side of its parent element. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Color

<!-- Before discussing the specifics of color, it's important to make two distinctions about color. Color can affect the following design aspects:

Foreground color
Background color
Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading has been styled.

Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled.

In CSS, these two design aspects can be styled with the following two properties:

color: this property styles an element's foreground color
background-color: this property styles an element's background color
h1 {
  color: red;
  background-color: blue;
}
In the example above, the text of the heading will appear in red, and the background of the heading will appear blue. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Opacity

<!-- Opacity is the measure of how transparent an element is. It's measured from 0 to 1, with 1 representing 100%, or fully visible and opaque, and 0 representing 0%, or fully invisible.

Opacity can be used to make elements fade into others for a nice overlay effect. To adjust the opacity of an element, the syntax looks like this:

.overlay {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
In the example above, the .overlay element would be 50% visible, letting whatever is positioned behind it show through. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS VISUAL RULES
Background Image

<!-- CSS has the ability to change the background of an element. One option is to make the background of an element an image. This is done through the CSS property background-image. Its syntax looks like this:

.main-banner {
  background-image: url("https://www.example.com/image.jpg");
}
The background-image property will set the element's background to display an image.
The value provided to background-image is a url. The url should be a url to an image. The url can be a file within your project, or it can be a link to an external site. To link to an image inside an existing project, you must provide a relative file path. If there was an image folder in the project, with an image named mountains.jpg, the relative file path would look like:
.main-banner {
  background-image: url("images/mountains.jpg");
} -->

THE BOX MODEL
Introduction to the Box Model

<!-- Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. This often leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience, while limiting the views you can create. In this lesson you will learn about the box model, an important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.

If you have used HTML and CSS, you have unknowingly seen aspects of the box model. For example, if you have set the background color of an element, you may have noticed that the color was applied not only to the area directly behind the element, but also to the area to the right of the element. Also, if you have aligned text, you know it is aligned relative to something. What is that something?

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box. This is what is meant by the box model.

For example, when you change the background color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the following aspects of the box model:

The dimensions of an element's box.
The borders of an element's box.
The paddings of an element's box.
The margins of an element's box.
Let's begin!
 -->
 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 THE BOX MODEL
The Box Model

<!-- The box model comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page. The model includes the content area's size (width and height) and the element's padding, border, and margin. The properties include:

Width and height — specifies the width and height of the content area.
Padding — specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.
Border — specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
Margin — specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.
The image to the right is a visual representation of the box model.

Open the box model image in a new tab so you can reference the box model as you move through the lesson. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Height and Width

<!-- An element's content has two dimensions: a height and a width. By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.

The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these default dimensions.

p {
  height: 80px;
  width: 240px;
}
In this example, the height and width of paragraph elements are set to 80 pixels and 240 pixels, respectively — the px in the code above stands for pixels.

Pixels allow you to set the exact size of an element's box (width and height). When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices — an element that fills a laptop screen will overflow a mobile screen. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Borders

<!-- A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.

width — The thickness of the border. A border's thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.
style — The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 10 different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and solid.
color — The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.
p {
  border: 3px solid coral;
}
In the example above, the border has a width of 3 pixels, a style of solid and a color of coral. All three properties are set in one line of code.

The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of the element. If width, style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns the default value for that property.

p.content-header {
  height: 80px;
  width: 240px;
  border: solid coral;
}
In this example, the border style is set to solid and the color is set to coral. The width is not set, so it defaults to medium. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Border Radius

<!-- Ever since we revealed the borders of boxes, you may have noticed that the borders highlight the true shape of an element's box: square. Thanks to CSS, a border doesn't have to be square.

You can modify the corners of an element's border box with the border-radius property.

div.container {
  border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
  border-radius: 5px;
}
The code in the example above will set all four corners of the border to a radius of 5 pixels (i.e. the same curvature that a circle with radius 5 pixels would have).

You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the height of the box, or to 100%.

div.container {
  height: 60px;
  width: 60px;
  border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
  border-radius: 100%;
}
The code in the example above creates a <div> that is a perfect circle. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Padding I

<!-- The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it. In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.

p.content-header {
  border: 3px solid coral;
  padding: 10px;
}
The code in this example puts 10 pixels of space between the content of the paragraph (the text) and the borders, on all four sides.

The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make content look less cramped.

If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box's content, you can use the following properties:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box's content, giving you more flexibility in customization.

p.content-header {
  border: 3px solid fuschia;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
}
In the example above, only the bottom side of the paragraph's content will have a padding of 10 pixels.	 -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=

THE BOX MODEL
Padding II

<!-- Another implementation of the padding property lets you specify exactly how much padding there should be on each side of the content in a single declaration.

p.content-header {
  border: 3px solid grey;
  padding: 6px 11px 4px 9px;
}
In the example above, the four values 6px 11px 4px 9px correspond to the amount of padding in a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the amount of padding on the top (6 pixels), right (11 pixels), bottom (4 pixels), and left (9 pixels) sides of the content.

When using this implementation of the padding property, we must specify a padding value for all four sides of the element.

However, if the top and bottom values for padding will equal each other, and the left and right values for padding will also equal each other, you can use the following shortcut:

p.content-header {
  padding: 5px 10px;
}
The first value, 5px, sets the padding value for the top and bottom sides of the content. The second value, 10px, sets the padding value for the left and right sides of the content. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Margins I

<!-- So far you've learned about the following components of the box model: content, borders, and padding. The fourth and final component of the box model is margin.

Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. The margin property is used to specify the size of this space.

p {
  border: 1px solid aquamarine;
  margin: 20px;
}
The code in the example above will place 20 pixels of space on the outside of the paragraph's box on all four sides. This means that other HTML elements on the page cannot come within 20 pixels of the paragraph's border.

If you want to be even more specific about the amount of margin on each side of a box, you can use the following properties:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
Each property affects the margin on only one side of the box, providing more flexibility in customization.

p {
  border: 3px solid DarkSlateGrey;
  margin-right: 15px;
}
In the example above, only the right side of the paragraph's box will have a margin of 15 pixels. It's common to see margin values used for a specific side of an element. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Margins II

<!-- What if you don't want equal margins on all four sides of the box?

A similar implementation of the margin property is used to specify exactly how much margin there should be on each side of the box in a single declaration.

p {
  margin: 6px 10px 5px 12px;
}
In the example above, the four values 6px 10px 5px 12px refer to the amount of margin around the box in a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the amount of margin on the top (6 pixels), right (10 pixels), bottom (5 pixels), and left (12 pixels) sides of the box.

When using this implementation of the margin property, the margin value must be specified for all four sides of the box.

Just like the padding shortcut, when you're certain that the top and bottom values for margin will equal each other, and that the left and right values for margin will also equal each other, you can use the following shortcut:

p {
  margin: 6px 12px;
}
The first value, 6px, sets a margin value for the top and bottom of the box. The second value, 12px, sets a margin value for the left and right sides of the box. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Auto

<!-- The margin property also lets you center content. However, you must follow a few syntax requirements. Take a look at the following example:

div {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
In the example above, margin: 0 auto; will center the divs in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element.

The div elements in the example above should center within an element that fills the page, but this doesn't occur. Why?

In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the full width of its containing element, like the <body>, for example. It's not possible to center an element that takes up the full width of the page.

div.headline {
  width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
In the example above, the width of the div is set to 400 pixels, which is less than the width of most screens. This will cause the div to center within a containing element that is greater than 400 pixels wide.
 -->

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 THE BOX MODEL
Margin Collapse

<!-- As you have seen, padding is space added inside an element's border, while margin is space added outside an element's border. One additional difference is that top and bottom margins, also called vertical margins, collapse, while top and bottom padding does not.

Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added together. For example, if two divs with ids #div-one and #div-two, are next to each other, they will be as far apart as the sum of their adjacent margins.

#img-one {
  margin-right: 20px;
}

#img-two {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
In this example, the space between the #img-one and #img-two borders is 40 pixels. The right margin of #img-one (20px) and the left margin of #img-two (20px) add to make a total margin of 40 pixels.

Unlike horizontal margins, vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger of the two vertical margins sets the distance between adjacent elements.

#img-one {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}

#img-two {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
In this example, the vertical margin between the #img-one and #img-two elements is 30 pixels. Although the sum of the margins is 50 pixels, the margin collapses so the spacing is only dependent on the #img-one bottom margin.

It may be helpful to think of collapsing vertical margins as a short person trying to push a taller person. The tall person has longer arms and can easily push the short person, while the person with short arms cannot reach the person with long arms. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
THE BOX MODEL
Minimum and Maximum Height and Width

<!-- Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing screen size, the content on the web page can suffer from those changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element's box can be sized to.

min-width — this property ensures a minimum width of an element's box.
max-width — this property ensures a maximum width of an element's box.
p {
  min-width: 300px;
  max-width: 600px;
}
In the example above, the width of all paragraphs will not shrink below 300 pixels, nor will the width exceed 600 pixels.

Content, like text, can become difficult to read when a browser window is narrowed or expanded. These two properties ensure that content is legible by limiting the minimum and maximum widths of an element.

You can also limit the minimum and maximum height of an element.

min-height — this property ensures a minimum height for an element's box.
max-height — this property ensures a maximum height of an element's box.
p {
  min-height: 150px;
  max-height: 300px;
}
In the example above, the height of all paragraphs will not shrink below 150 pixels and the height will not exceed 300 pixels.

What will happen to the contents of an element's box if the max-height property is set too low? It's possible for the content to spill outside of the box, resulting in content that is not legible. You'll learn how to work around this issue in the next exercise.
 -->

 THE BOX MODEL
Overflow


<!-- All of the components of the box model comprise an element’s size. For example, an image that has the following dimensions is 364 pixels wide and 244 pixels tall.

300 pixels wide
200 pixels tall
10 pixels padding on the left and right
10 pixels padding on the top and bottom
2 pixels border on the left and right
2 pixels border on the top and bottom
20 pixels margin on the left and right
10 pixels margin on the top and bottom
The total dimensions (364px by 244px) are calculated by adding all of the vertical dimensions together and all of the horizontal dimensions together. Sometimes, these components result in an element that is larger than the parent's containing area.

How can we ensure that we can view all of an element that is larger than its parent's containing area?

The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. It can be set to one of the following values:

hidden - when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.
scroll - when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element's box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.
visible - when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the default value.
p {
  overflow: scroll; 
}
In the example above, if any of the paragraph content overflows (perhaps a user resizes their browser window), a scrollbar will appear so that users can view the rest of the content.

The overflow property is set on a parent element to instruct a web browser how to render child elements. For example, if a div’s overflow property is set to scroll, all children of this div will display overflowing content with a scroll bar. -->

THE BOX MODEL
Resetting Defaults

<!-- All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets are known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term "user agent" is a technical term for the browser.

User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer to design or style a web page.

Many developers choose to reset these default values so that they can truly work with a clean slate.

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
The code in the example above resets the default margin and padding values of all HTML elements. It is often the first CSS rule in an external stylesheet.

Note that both properties are both set to 0. When these properties are set to 0, they do not require a unit of measurement.
	 -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++=

THE BOX MODEL
Visibility

<!-- Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.

The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:

hidden — hides an element.
visible — displays an element.
<ul>
  <li>Explore</li>
  <li>Connect</li>
  <li class="future">Donate</li>
<ul>
.future {
  visibility: hidden;
}
In the example above, the list item with a class of future will be hidden from view in the browser.

Keep in mind, however, that users can still view the contents of the list item (e.g., Donate) by viewing the source code in their browser. Furthermore, the web page will only hide the contents of the element. It will still leave an empty space where the element is intended to display.

Note: What's the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? An element with display: none will be completely removed from the web page. An element with visibility: hidden, however, will not be visible on the web page, but the space reserved for it will.	  -->

CHANGING THE BOX MODEL
Why Change the Box Model?

<!-- The last lesson focused on the most important aspects of the box model: box dimensions, borders, padding, and margin.

The box model, however, has an awkward limitation regarding box dimensions. This limitation is best illustrated with an example.

<h1>Hello World</h1>
h1 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
}
In the example above, a heading element's box has solid, black, 1 pixel thick borders. The height of the box is 200 pixels, while the width of the box is 300 pixels. A padding of 10 pixels has also been set on all four sides of the box's content.

Unfortunately, under the current box model, the border thickness and the padding will affect the dimensions of the box.

The 10 pixels of padding increases the height of the box to 220 pixels and the width to 320 pixels. Next, the 1-pixel thick border increases the height to 222 pixels and the width to 322 pixels.

Under this box model, the border thickness and padding are added to the overall dimensions of the box. This makes it difficult to accurately size a box. Over time, this can also make all of a web page's content difficult to position and manage.

In this brief lesson, you'll learn how to use a different technique that avoids this problem altogether. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CHANGING THE BOX MODEL
Box Model: Content-Box

<!-- Many properties in CSS have a default value and don't have to be explicitly set in the stylesheet.

For example, the default font-weight of text is normal, but this property-value pair is not typically specified in a stylesheet.

The same can be said about the box model that browsers assume. In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box model the browser should use when interpreting a web page.

The default value of this property is content-box. This is the same box model that is affected by border thickness and padding. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CHANGING THE BOX MODEL
Box Model: Border-Box

<!-- Fortunately, we can reset the entire box model and specify a new one: border-box.

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
The code in the example above resets the box model to border-box for all HTML elements. This new box model avoids the dimensional issues that exist in the former box model you learned about.

In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.

<h1>Hello World</h1>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1 {
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
}
In the example above, the height of the box would remain at 200 pixels and the width would remain at 300 pixels. The border thickness and padding would remain entirely inside of the box. -->
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CHANGING THE BOX MODEL
The New Box Model

<!-- Now that you know about the new box model, let's actually implement it in the browser.

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
It's that simple! In the example above, the universal selector (*) targets all elements on the web page and sets their box model to the border-box model.
 -->
 In style.css, change the box model for all elements on the web page to the new box model.

You probably didn't see a difference in the web page to the right - that's ok! The new box model simply makes sure that the dimensions of elements remains the same regardless of border width and padding.

CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Flow of HTML

<!-- A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML.

In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

In this lesson, you will learn five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the browser:

position
display
z-index
float
clear
Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.

 -->

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Position

<!-- Take a look at the block-level elements in the image below:
Block-level elements like these boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space. The boxes in the image above were created with the following CSS:

.boxes {
  width: 120px;
  height: 70px;
}
and the following HTML:

<div class="boxes"></div>
<div class="boxes"></div>
Notice the block-level elements in the image above take up their own line of space and therefore don't overlap each other. In the browser to the right you can see block-level elements also consistently appear on the left side of the browser. This is the default position for block-level elements.

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of four values:

static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
relative
absolute
fixed
In the next few exercises, you'll learn about the values in items 2, 3, and 4 above. For now, it's important to understand that if you favor the default position of an HTML element, you don't need to set its position property. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Position: Relative

<!-- 
One way to modify the default position of an element is by setting its position property to relative.

This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page.

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: relative;
}
Although the code in the example above instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the div, it does not specify where the div should be positioned on the page.

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
In the example above, the <div> has been positioned using two of the four offset properties. The valid offset properties are:

top - moves the element down.
bottom - moves the element up.
left - moves the element right.
right - moves the element left.
In the example above, the <div> will be moved down 20 pixels and to the right 50 pixels from its default static position. The image below displays the new position of the box. The dotted line represents where the statically positioned (default) box was positioned.
Units for offset properties can be specified in pixels, ems, or percentages. Note that offset properties will not work if the value of the element's position property is the default static. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Position: Absolute

<!-- Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to absolute.

When an element's position is set to absolute all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element.

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will be moved down and right from the top left corner of the view. If offset properties weren't specified, the top box would be entirely covered by the bottom box. Take a look at the gif below:



The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.

In the next exercise, we will compare the scrolling of absolute elements with fixed elements. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Position: Fixed

<!-- When an element's position is set to absolute, as in the last exercise, the element will scroll with the rest of the document when a user scrolls.

We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed.

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;

}
In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will remain fixed to its position no matter where the user scrolls on the page, like in the image below:
This technique is often used for navigation bars on a web page. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Z-Index

<!-- When boxes on a web page have a combination of different positions, the boxes (and therefore, their content) can overlap with each other, making the content difficult to read or consume.

.box-top {
  background-color: Aquamarine;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> ignores the .box-top <div> and overlaps it as a user scrolls.

The z-index property controls how far "back" or how far "forward" an element should appear on the web page when elements overlap. This can be thought of the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements.

The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be displayed on the web page.

.box-top {
  background-color: Aquamarine;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
  z-index: 1;
}
In the example above, we set the .box-top position to relative and the z-index to 2. We changed position to relative, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of 2 moves the .box-top element forward, because it is greater than the .box-bottom z-index, 1. See the example image below:
In the image above, you can see the top box is moved in front of the bottom box. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Inline Display

<!-- Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to other elements.

In this lesson, we’ll cover three values for the display property: inline, block, and inline-block.

The default display for some tags, such as <em>, <strong>, and <a>, is called inline. """"Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document""". For example, the text of an anchor tag (<a>) will, by default, be displayed on the same line as the surrounding text, and it will only be as wide as necessary to contain its content. inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.

To learn more about <em>inline</em> elements, read <a href="#">MDN documentation</a>.
In the example above, the <em> element is inline, because it displays its content on the same line as the content surrounding it, including the anchor tag. This example will display:

To learn more about inline elements, click MDN documentation.

The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.

h1 {
  display: inline;
}
The CSS in the example above will change the display of all <h1> elements to inline. The browser will render <h1> elements on the same line as other inline elements immediately before or after them (if there are any). -->

#1. In index.html, add opening and closing <strong></strong> tags around "Welcome." Notice that the element does not move. That's because <strong> elements are inline, so they can share lines with other elements.	In index.html, add opening and closing <strong></strong> tags around "Welcome." Notice that the element does not move. That's because <strong> elements are inline, so they can share lines with other elements.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Block Display

<!-- Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level elements. """These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content."""

Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements (<h1> through <h6>), <p>, <div> and <footer>. For a complete list of block level elements, visit the MDN documentation.

strong {
  display: block;
}
In the example above, all <strong> elements will be displayed on their own line, with no content directly on either side of them even though their contents may not fill the width of most computer screens. -->

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Inline-Block Display

<!-- The third value for the display property is inline-block. Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.

For example, <div>s in the CSS below will be displayed on the same line and with the specified dimensions:

<div class="rectangle">
  <p>I’m a rectangle!</p>
</div>
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>So am I!</p>
</div>
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>Me three!</p>
</div>
.rectangle {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
}
In the example above, there are three rectangular divs that each contain a paragraph of text. The .rectangle <div>s will all appear inline (provided there is enough space from left to right) with a width of 200 pixels and height of 300 pixels, even though the text inside of them may not require 200 pixels by 300 pixels of space.
 -->

1.Let's fix the display of the <li> tags in the menu at the top of the page.

Set the display property of li elements to inline-block.

2.
Set the width of the li elements to 80 pixels.

3.
Now, we can reduce the top offset of the "Welcome" section. Set it to 50 pixels.

4.
Set the display property of .answer elements to inline-block.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Float

<!-- So far, you've learned how to specify the exact position of an element using offset properties. If you're simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible on the page, you can use the float property.

The float property can be set to one of two values:

left - this value will move, or float, elements as far left as possible.
right - this value will move elements as far right as possible.
.boxes {
  width: 120px;
  height: 70px;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  float: right;
}
In the example above, we float the .box-bottom element to the right. This works for static and relative positioned elements. See the result of the code below:



Floated elements must have a width specified, as in the example above. Otherwise, the element will assume the full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results. -->

#1.Set the float property of the .answer element to left.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Clear

<!-- The float property can also be used to float multiple elements at once. However, when multiple floated elements have different heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can "bump" into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.

The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can take on one of the following values:

left — the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
right — the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
both — neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.
none — the element can touch either side.
div {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
}

div.special {
  clear: left;
}
In the example above, all <div>s on the page are floated to the left side. The element with class special did not move all the way to the left because a taller <div> blocked its positioning. By setting its clear property to left, the special <div> will be moved all the way to the left side of the page. -->

1.
Take a look at the .answer divs on the web page. They have been floated to the left, but the .question divs are touching the .answer divs on the right, let's fix this.

In the .question selector, set the clear property to left. Notice how the questions moved.

2.
On second thought, this layout is not looking so good. Remove the float property from .answer and the clear property from .question.

CSS COLOR
Introduction to Color

<!-- CSS supports a wide variety of colors. These include named colors, like blue, black, and LimeGreen, along with colors described by a numeric value. Using a numeric system allows us to take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that browsers support. In this lesson, we're going to explore all the color options CSS offers.

Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:

Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness
We'll learn about and explore the benefits of each of these in depth. Using only named colors, you may feel like you're picking labeled crayons out of a box. By the end of this lesson, you'll feel like a painter mixing paints on a palette. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS COLOR
Foreground vs Background

<!-- Before discussing the specifics of color, it's important to make two distinctions about color. Color can affect the following design aspects:

The foreground color
The background color
Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading has been styled.

Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled

In CSS, these two design aspects can be styled with the following two properties:

color - this property styles an element's foreground color.
background-color - this property styles an element's background color.
h1 {
  color: Red;
  background-color: Blue;
}
In the example above, the text of the heading will appear in red, and the background of the heading will appear blue. -->

1.
In style.css, set the foreground color of the h1 heading to MidnightBlue.

2.
Next, set the background color of the h1 heading to Aqua.

Notice that the background-color property did not change the background color of the entire page. Instead, only the background area behind heading changed. We'll learn why this occurs in more detail later in the course.

Note: The background color of the heading will block the image of the coffee.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS COLOR
Hexadecimal

<!-- One syntax that we can use to specify colors is called hexadecimal. Colors specified using this system are called hex colors. A hex color begins with a hash character (#) which is followed by three or six characters. The characters represent values for red, blue and green.

DarkSeaGreen: #8FBC8F
Sienna:       #A0522D
SaddleBrown:  #8B4513
Brown:        #A52A2A
Black:        #000000 or #000
White:        #FFFFFF or #FFF
Aqua:         #00FFFF or #0FF
In the example above, you may notice that there are both letters and numbers in the values. This is because the hexadecimal number system has 16 digits (0-15) instead of 10 (0-9) like you are used to. To represent 10-15, we use A-F. Here is a list of many different colors and their hex values.

Notice that Black, White, and Aqua are all represented with both three characters and six characters. This can be done with hex colors whose number pairs are the same characters. In the example above, Aqua can be represented as #0FF because both of the first two characters are 0 and the second and third pairs of characters are both Fs. Keep in mind that all three character hex colors can be represented with six characters (by repeating each character twice) but the same is not true in reverse.

You can include hex colors just as you would include named colors: background-color: #9932cc;.
 -->
1.
In the browser is a web page that uses named colors and hex colors. We're going to translate the named colors into hex, to be more consistent. The colors won't visually change, yet.

In style.css, find the CSS rule that uses the named color DarkSeaGreen and change it to its hex value, #8FBC8F.

2.
Find the four other named colors of the roast types and convert them to their hex values, as shown here:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS COLOR
RGB Colors

<!-- There is another syntax for representing RGB values that uses decimal numbers. It looks like this:

h1 {
  color: rgb(23, 45, 23);
}
Here, each of the three values represents a color component, and each can have a decimal number value from 0 to 255. The first number represents the amount of red, the second is green, and the third is blue. These colors are exactly the same as hex, but with a different syntax and a different number system.

In general, hex and decimal color representations are equivalent. Which you choose is a matter of personal taste. That said, it's good to choose one and be consistent throughout your CSS, because it's easier to compare hex to hex and decimal to decimal.
 -->
1.
In style.css, find the hex value #8FBC8F and change it to rgb(143, 188, 143).

2.
In style.css, find the hex value #A0522D and change it to rgb(160, 82, 45).

3.
In style.css, find the hex value #8B4513 and change it to rgb(139, 69, 19).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS COLOR
Hex and RGB

<!-- The hexadecimal and RGB color system can represent many more colors than the small set of CSS named colors. We can use this new set of colors to refine our web page's style.

In both hex and decimal, we have three values, one for each color. Each can be one of 256 values. Specifically, 256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216. That is the amount of colors we can now represent. Compare that to the 147 named CSS colors!

Recall that we started with named colors, converted them to hex, and then converted some of the hex colors to decimal. Unless we made a mistake, all of the colors should still be the same, visually. Let's use our broadened palette to make some more refined color choices.
 -->
1.
In the .green rule in style.css, change the background color to #9EB599.

Run the code. Can you tell the difference?

2.
In the .light rule in style.css, change the background color to #683C2C.

3.
In the .city rule in style.css, change the background color to #4C352D.

4.
In the .vienna rule in style.css, change the background color to #352926.

5.
In the .italian rule in style.css, change the background color to #141212.

Run the code one more time. These new colors are a lot closer to the real-life color of each type of coffee. How does the subtle difference feel?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS COLOR
Hue, Saturation, and Lightness

<!-- The RGB color scheme is convenient because it's very close to how computers represent colors internally. There's another equally powerful system in CSS called the hue-saturation-lightness color scheme, abbreviated as HSL.

The syntax for HSL is similar to the decimal form of RGB, though it differs in important ways. The first number represents the degree of the hue, and can be between 0 and 360. The second and third numbers are percentages representing saturation and lightness respectively. Here is an example:

color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);
Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel. Red is 0 degrees, Green is 120 degrees, Blue is 240 degrees, and then back to Red at 360. You can see an example of a color wheel below:

color wheel

Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. If you imagine a line segment drawn from the center of the color wheel to the perimeter, the saturation is a point on that line segment. If you spin that line segment to different angles, you'll see how that saturation looks for different hues. The saturation increases towards 100% as the point gets closer to the edge (the color becomes more rich). The saturation decreases towards 0% as the point gets closer to the center (the color becomes more gray).

Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. Imagine a sliding dimmer on a light switch that starts halfway. Sliding the dimmer up towards 100% makes the color lighter, closer to white. Sliding the dimmer down towards 0% makes the color darker, closer to black.

HSL is convenient for adjusting colors. In RGB, making the color a little darker may affect all three color components. In HSL, that's as easy as changing the lightness value. HSL is also useful for making a set of colors that work well together by selecting various colors that have the same lightness and saturation but different hues.
 -->
1.
In the browser is a simple page with different colored rectangles.

In style.css, modify the lightness of the background color of the class selector .midground to be 25%.

2.
Change the saturation of the background color of the .foreground class selector to 50%.

3.
Change the hue of the body selector's background color to 240 degrees.

CSS COLOR
Opacity and Alpha

<!-- All of the colors we've seen so far have been opaque, or non-transparent. When we overlap two opaque elements, nothing from the bottom element shows through the top element. In this exercise, we'll change the opacity, or the amount of transparency, of some colors so that some or all of the bottom elements are visible through a covering element.

To use opacity in the HSL color scheme, use hsla instead of hsl, and four values instead of three. For example:

color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1);
The first three values work the same as hsl. The fourth value (which we have not seen before) is the alpha. This last value is sometimes called the opacity.

Alpha is a decimal number from zero to one. If alpha is zero, the color will be completely transparent. If alpha is one, the color will be opaque. The value for half transparent would be 0.5.

You can think of the alpha value as, "the amount of the background to mix with the foreground". When a color's alpha is below one, any color behind it will be blended in. The blending happens for each pixel; no blurring occurs.

The RGB color scheme has a similar syntax for opacity, rgba. Again, the first three values work the same as rgb and the last value is the alpha. Here's an example:

color: rgba(234, 45, 98, 0.33);
Alpha can only be used with HSL and RGB colors; we cannot add the alpha value to color: green color: #FFFFF.

There is, however, a named color keyword for zero opacity, transparent. It's equivalent to rgba(0, 0, 0, 0). It's used like any other color keyword:

color: transparent;
 -->

1.
Give the element with class .foreground an alpha value of 0.6. Remember to change hsl to hsla.

2.
Give the element with class .midground an alpha value of 0.4 using hsla.

Run the code, and notice how all the colors blend depending on how they overlap.

3.
Modify the body selector's background color to have a value of rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5).

4.
Now, set the alpha of the document body to 0.1. How does opacity change the background?

#style.css


html,
body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
}

.wrapper {
  position: relative;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 0;
  max-width: 75vw;
}

.midground, .foreground {
  position: absolute;

CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Typography

<!-- In this lesson, we'll focus on typography, the art of arranging text on a page. In particular, we'll look at how to style fonts with CSS to make them legible and appealing and how to add external fonts to your web pages.

Some of the most important information a user will see on a web page will be textual. Styling text to make page content accessible and engaging can significantly improve user experience. Let's begin!

Instructions
In the browser, we have a blog site with fonts of different sizes and styles. In the following exercises, we'll learn how to manipulate fonts to create engaging interfaces.

Once you have an idea of the general layout of the page, proceed to the next exercise.
 -->

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font Family

<!-- If you've ever used a formatted word processor, chances are that you probably also used a feature that allowed you change the "type of font" you were typing in. The phrase "type of font" refers to the technical term typeface, or font family.

To change the typeface of text on your web page, you can use the font-family property.

h1 {
  font-family: Garamond;
}
In the example above, the font family for all main heading elements has been set to Garamond.

When setting typefaces on a web page, keep the following points in mind:

The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visit the web page. We'll learn how to work around this issue in a later exercise.

You've probably noticed that we haven't been specifying a typeface in previous exercises of this course. How exactly does the browser know what typeface to use when displaying the web page? The default typeface for all most browsers is Times New Roman. You may be familiar with this typeface if you have ever used a formatted word processor.

It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3.

When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized), like so:

h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}
 -->

1.
In style.css, change the font family of h1 and h2 elements to Georgia.

2.
Next, change the font family of the paragraph to Helvetica.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font Weight

<!-- You've probably noticed bold text in websites you use, especially in news or text-heavy sites. It's common to bold important headings or keywords. In CSS, we can style bold text with the font-weight property.

If we want to bold text in a web page, we can set the font-weight to bold.

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
If we want to ensure that text is not bold, we can set the font-weight to normal.

p {
  font-weight: normal;
}
By default, the font-weight of most text elements is set to normal. Some elements, like headers, have built-in bold styling. A good approach is to check to see if the the text element has any default styling, and use the font-weight property accordingly.
 -->
Instructions
1.
Taking a look at the web page in the browser, you'll notice a "Banner" section, the blue section right below the navigation menu.

In style.css, in the banner section of the stylesheets, set the font weight of the paragraph within class banner to bold. You'll notice that the letters in the paragraph in the web page thicken.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font Weight II

<!-- The font-weight property can also be assigned a number value to style text on a numeric scale ranging from 100 to 900. Valid values are multiples of 100 within this range such as 200 or 500.

When using numeric weights, there are a number of default font weights that we can use:

400 is the default font-weight of most text.
700 signifies a bold font-weight.
300 signifies a light font-weight.
Let's take a look at an example of how numeric fonts are used.

header {
  font-weight: 800;
}

footer {
  font-weight: 200;
}
Here, the header would appear as a deep bold, while the footer would appear rather light.

It's important to note that not all fonts can be assigned a numeric font-weight. You can look up the font you are using to see which font-weight values are available.
 -->
Instructions
1.
The header section of the webpage is where the navigation menu is. It lives at the very top of the page.

In style.css, in the header section, set the font weight of the element with class header to 900. You'll notice the list elements in the navigation thicken.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font Style

<!-- You can also italicize text with the font-style property.

h3 {
  font-style: italic;
}
The italic value causes text to appear in italics. The font-style property also has a normal value which is the default.
 -->
Instructions
1.
The web page features three sections, "Garamond", "Helvetica", and "Space Mono". Each of these sections includes a line with the name of the font creator, such as "Claude Garamond".

Let's italicize the creator's name on each of these cards. In style.css, in the font card section, set the font style of .font-card .creator to italic.

Notice the font change from normal to italic on the web page.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Word Spacing

<!-- You can also increase the spacing between words in a body of text, technically known as word spacing.

To do so, you can use the word-spacing property:

h1 {
  word-spacing: 0.3em;
}
The default amount of space between words is usually 0.25em. In the example above, the word spacing is set to 0.3em, which represents an increase of only .05em in word spacing.

It's not common to increase the spacing between words, but it may help enhance the readability of bolded or enlarged text. Note, again, that the preferred unit is ems.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In style.css, set the word spacing of the h2 elements to 0.05em.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Letter Spacing

<!-- You've learned how to increase the spacing between lines of text and words, but it's possible to get even more detailed: increasing the spacing between individual letters.

The technical term for adjusting the spacing between letters is called "kerning". Kerning can be adjusted with the letter-spacing property in CSS.

h1 {
  letter-spacing: 0.3em;
}
Like word spacing, it's not common to increase the kerning in text, but sometimes it enhances the readability of uppercase text.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In style.css, set the letter spacing of the h2 elements to 0.02em.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Text Transformation

<!-- Text can also be styled to appear in either all uppercase or lowercase with the text-transform property.

h1 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
The code in the example above formats all <h1> elements to appear in uppercase, regardless of the case used for the heading within the HTML code. Alternatively, the lowercase value could be used to format text in all lowercase.

Since text can be directly typed in all uppercase or lowercase within an HTML file, what is the point of a CSS rule that allows you to format letter case?

Depending on the type of content a web page displays, it may make sense to always style a specific element in all uppercase or lowercase letters. For example, a website that reports breaking news may decide to format all <h1> heading elements such that they always appear in all uppercase, as in the example above. It would also avoid uppercase text in the HTML file, which could make code difficult to read.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In style.css, transform the text in the main heading (h1) to appear uppercase.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Text Alignment

<!-- No matter how much styling is applied to text (typeface, size, weight, etc.), text always appears on the left side of the browser.

To move, or align, text, we can use the text-align property.

h1 {
  text-align: right;
}
The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:

left - aligns text to the left hand side of the browser.
center - centers text.
right - aligns text to the right hand side of the browser.
Later in the course, you'll learn exactly how the browser positions HTML elements by default, which will help you understand how the browser "aligns" text, since "align" is a relative term. For now, it's enough to know that text can be moved to the left, center, or right side of the web page.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In style.css, set the text-align property of the main heading (h1) so that it appears on the left.

2.
On second thought, the heading looks better in the center. Reset the heading so that it is aligned to the center.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Line Height Anatomy

<!-- Another property that we can set for text is line-height. This property modifies the leading of text.

The diagram to the right helps illustrate exactly what the terms "leading" and "line height" mean. -->

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Line Height

<!-- We often modify line-height to make text on a web page easier to read. When text is styled to appear larger, the vertical spacing between lines of text can decrease, creating text that is difficult to read, particularly in paragraphs.

We can use the line-height property to set how tall we want the line containing our text to be, regardless of the height of the text. Line heights can take one of several values:

A unitless number, such as 1.2. This number is an absolute value that will compute the line height as a ratio of the font size.
A number specified by unit, such as 12px. This number can be any valid CSS unit, such as pixels, percents, ems, or rems.
Generally, the unitless ratio value is the preferred method, since it is responsive and based exclusively on the current font size. In other words, if we change the font size, a unitless line-height would automatically readjust, whereas the pixel value would remain static.

p {
  line-height: 1.4;
}
 -->

Instructions
1.
Let's change the line height of the text within the banner.

In style.css, set the line height of the paragraph element within the banner class to 1.4. You'll notice the line height increase.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Serif and Sans Serif

<!-- You've learned a lot of properties to modify text on a web page!

In the next exercise, you'll set some text to be serif and some text to be sans-serif. What exactly do these words mean?

Serif — fonts that have extra details on the ends of each letter. Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.

Sans-Serif — fonts that do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. Instead, letters have straight, flat edges, like Arial or Helvetica. -->

Instructions
Notice the difference between serif fonts and sans-serif fonts in the diagram to the right. When you're done, proceed to the next exercise.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Fallback Fonts

<!-- What happens when a stylesheet requires a font that is not installed on a user's computer? Most computers have a small set of typefaces pre-installed. This small set includes serif fonts like Times New Roman and sans-serif fonts like Arial.

These pre-installed fonts serve as fallback fonts if the stylesheet specifies a font which is not installed on a user's computer.

To use fallback fonts, the following syntax is required:

h1 {
  font-family: "Garamond", "Times", serif;
}
The CSS rule above says:

Use the Garamond font for all <h1> elements on the web page.
If Garamond is not available, use the Times font.
If Garamond and Times are not available, use any serif font pre-installed on the user's computer.
The fonts specified after Garamond are the fallback fonts (Times, serif). Fallback fonts help ensure a consistent experience for the diverse audience of users that visit a site.
 -->
Instructions
1.
Below the banner, the web page is made of three main font sections, Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace. Each of these sections shows an example font, Garamond, Helvetica, and Space Mono, respectively.

We'll focus on styling the Garamond setion here. In style.css, in the "Font Card" section, create the selector .garamond .sample .text.

2.
Using the selector you just created, set the font to Garamond and add serif as a fallback font.

3.
In style.css, below the last selector you made, create the selector .helvetica .sample .text.

4.
Using the selector you just created, set the font to Helvetica and add sans-serif as a fallback font.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Linking Fonts I

<!-- With the number of fonts available with modern typography, it is unrealistic to expect users to have all fonts installed on their computers. New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to these fonts as non-user fonts.

Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available for free use. Google Fonts gives us a way to retrieve the link for a single font, multiple fonts, or multiple fonts with the font-weight and font-style properties.

We'll show you where to add this link in the next exercise.
 -->
Instructions
1. View the video in this exercise.

The video demonstrates how to retrieve the link for a single font, multiple fonts, and multiple fonts of various numeric font weights and font styles.



2. Once you have viewed the video, repeat these steps in the browser on your desktop computer, selecting the Space Mono font specifying both the regular (400) and bold (700) font-weights.

When you are ready, click 'Next' to continue.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Linking Fonts II

<!-- When we have the link to the font of our choice, we can add the font to the <head> section of the HTML document, using the <link> tag and the href.

Let's take a look at a few examples:

1. A single linked font, using Droid Serif as an example:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>


2. Multiple linked fonts, using the Droid Serif and Playfair Display fonts as an example:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif|Playfair+Display" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>


3. Multiple linked fonts, along with weights and styles. Here Droid Serif has font weights of 400, 700, and 700i, while Playfair Display has font weights of 400, 700, and 900i:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif:400,700,700i|Playfair+Display:400,700,900i" rel="stylesheet">
</head>


Once a font is linked, we can create CSS selectors to target elements, just as we do with other fonts.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In the previous exercise, you surfaced the link to the Space Mono font specifying both the normal (400) and bold (700) font weights.

In index.html include this font in the project using the <link> tag.

The url to reference in the the link tag is:

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Space+Mono:400,700
2.
In style.css, in the "Font Card" section, create the selector .space .sample .text.

3.
Using the selector you just created, set the font to "Space Mono" and add monospace as a fallback font.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font-Face I

<!-- There are other ways to link non-user fonts that don't require the use of the <link> tag in the HTML document. CSS offers a way to import fonts directly into stylesheets with the @font-face property.

To load fonts with the @font-face property:

Instead of using the font's link in the HTML document, enter the link into the URL bar in the browser.
The browser will load the CSS rules. You will need to focus on the rules that are directly labeled as /* latin */. Some of the latin rules are on separate lines. You will need each of these.
Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin, and paste the rules from the browser to the top of style.css.
It is important to stress the need to copy the @font-face rules to the top of the stylesheet for the font to load correctly in the project.
 -->
Instructions
1. View the video in this exercise.

The video demonstrates how to enter the Space Mono font link you previously retrieved into the browser. The browser in turn displays the rules you will use for the font.



2. Once you have viewed the video, repeat these steps in the browser on your desktop computer, with link for the Space Mono font with normal (400) and bold (700) font-weights. You can find the direct link to the font here.

Once your desktop browser displays the rules, click 'Next' to continue.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font-Face II

<!-- We can then use the fonts in the stylesheets as you would use any other font. Let's practice loading an external font in our stylesheets using the @font-face property, and using the font to style our page.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In index.html remove the link to the Space Mono font that you added in the previous exercise.

2.
Now, add this same font to style.css using the @font-face rules labeled latin.

Recall that in order to do this, we use the same CSS rules returned in the browser for the Space Mono font, and copy the latin @font-face rules to the top of the stylesheet.

If you need help retrieving the link for the appropriate font, click here.

Once you add the font, you'll notice that the elements styled in the Space Mono font retain the correct font styling.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CSS TYPOGRAPHY
Font-Face III

<!-- While Google Fonts and other resources can broaden font selection, you may wish to use an entirely different font or abstain from using a font from an external service.

We can modify our @font-face rule to use local font files as well. We can supply the user with the desired font family and host it along with our site instead of depending on a different site.

@font-face {
  font-family: "Roboto";
  src: url(fonts/Roboto.woff2) format('woff2'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.woff) format('woff'),
       url(fonts/Roboto.tff) format('truetype');
}
Here, you'll notice:

The main difference is the use of a relative filepath instead of a web URL.

We add a format for each file to specify which font to use. Different browsers support different font types, so providing multiple font file options will support more browsers.

As of now .woff2 appears to be the way of the future, due to greatly reduced file sizes and improved performance, but many browsers still don’t support it. There are lots of great sources to find fonts to use locally, such as Font Squirrel.
 -->
Instructions
1.
In the fonts/ directory, you'll notice that we have added several local font files.

Let's change the typography of the banner, using local font files. If you open up the fonts/ directory using the file navigator in the code editor, you'll notice that we have added local font files Glegoo-Regular.ttf and Glegoo-Bold.ttf.

At the top of style.css, create a selector using the @font-face property and give it the font family Glegoo.

2.
Within the @font-face rule, add a src attribute with the relative path of the file Glegoo-Regular.ttf and a format of truetype. Make sure to include this path in the url() parentheses.

3.
Using the selector that targets the paragraph nested within the banner class, add the font family Glegoo and a font size of 20px.

Reload the page to see the changes in the browser.
